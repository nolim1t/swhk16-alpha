        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>Vaultarch is a secure service for card collectors and players to protect against counterfeiting, theft and loss by registering images of their most valuable cards.</p>

          <p>Access is available by website on every web browser, and is tailored to offer a great viewing experience and functionality on modern mobile phones.</p>

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why should card collectors register their top cards?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>Increasingly realistic forged cards have been emerging in the last few years. Even if you never buy any counterfeits, your collection may still lose value. The consensus is that today’s counterfeits can be identified by experts, but the forgeries of the future may be much more challenging to detect. So how will you prove in future years that the cards you have today are genuine?</p>

          <p>Registering in Vaultarch<br>
          a card’s images, <br>
          your identity, and generating automated <br>
          timestamps, <br>
          will protect your card from being accused of being a future forgery.</p>

          <p>The sooner you take action the better. The clock is ticking.</p>

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What can I do once my cards are stored in Vaultarch?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>First you can relax: your valuable cards are documented securely and persistently in the data store, associated with your identity, and a timestamp. Other users cannot see your cards or profile.</p>

          <p>Secondly, you can add more information to your card history over time. You can detail the source of the card, including images of sales receipts etc. You can add more refined images of the cards, or, if the condition of the card changes, through damage or alter, you can add new images.</p>

          <p>Thirdly, if you want to sell your card, you can show the physical card, and a prospective buyer to bring up the picture on his own phone. He can then compare the high resolution image with his your card to know that this card has transfer its ownership with Vaultech to some other member, when you the new owner will also get all the timestamps as proof of provenance, facilitating the sale or exchange.</p>

          <p>When the physical Card is exchanged, you can transfer the ownership, so that the new owner has it in his/her Vaultarch.</p>
