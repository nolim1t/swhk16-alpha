                        Counterfeits are getting better every year. But you can protect yourself against future counterfeits, by logging images of your valuable cards into the Vaultarch secure database today. <br><br>
                        Load high-definition mobile phone or camera images of your valuable cards into Vaultarch today. Then if you want to sell or trade them in the future, you can have the histories to prove that these particular cards existed today.<br><br>
                        When you hand over a card to its new owner, you can also hand over to them the digital history of the card, including its new ownership details. So the new owner will have the same protection that you did.<br><br>
                        Take action today and lock in the future value of your cards.

                    <p class="lead">
                        "Provenance": a record of ownership of a work of art or an antique, used as a guide to authenticity or quality.<br><br>
                        Once a card is registered, additional data can be added (e.g. descriptions of how the card was acquired, the card was sourced, original sales receipts, new images, etc).
                        This builds a picture of historical card ownership.<br><br>
                        These records help build confidence and security in the community.

                        We have built an additional community check system, in which you can contact Experts to check either the real card or sometimes HD pictures of it and try to detect counterfeits.<br><br>
                        Having an Expert validation of your cards does not fully guarantee they are genuine, but adds a layer of trust and protection of your assets.

                        We are working with insurance companies to help users to insure the cards recorded in Vaultarch against theft or destruction. An accurate record of the valuable cards in the collection will allow the insurance company to price the insurance correctly. If the worst happens and the cards are lost, then their fate can be marked in the database to alert the owner and the authorities if the cards do surface. <br><br>
